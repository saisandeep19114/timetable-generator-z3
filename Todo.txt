AS the program has many features but it also lacks many aswell. As of now this cannot be used for practical puposes.

This is the list of all the features that this program lacks and are yet to be done -

	1.By default if it finds any professor/lab taking two/more courses or branches, it makes sure that all the classes taken by this sir are not coinciding.
	2.If you want any special lectures/courses to be common for some professors/ labs, it cannot be done.
	3.The slot details that are given in slots.xlsx file are just for reference perpose.
	4.These slot details are hardcoded in the source code, so they cannot be changed in any way.
	5.By default the program assumes that the number of labs available for each is only one.
	6.If you want to make the timetable for two or more labs, it cannot be done.
