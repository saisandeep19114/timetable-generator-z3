description and format of the "input.txt" file.

It  represents the names of the files from the "inputfiles" directory.

$department={cs,ee,me}

$n={1,2,3}

Every line in the file  "input.txt"  is  in the format "sem$n_$department.txt".

->  for now, $n is from 1 to 3 , however we could add some more by  exending $n and $department.
