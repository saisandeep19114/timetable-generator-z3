description and format of the "professor_details.txt" file

"professor_details.txt" is of a distinct format which basically provides the name of the professor for every distinct course(all courses).

Professor name may repeat as one may teach two or more courses.


It starts with a line stating "START" and ends at a line with "END"

Every course and it's tutor  goes inbetween the "START" and "END" with the following format ::

for a course "COURSE&&&" with it's tutor as "ABCD" goes in the file inbetween the "START" and the "END" as following term:

//
COURSE&&&
ABCD
//



NOTE:: "//" are must be included as given in the format

        Following one course term another shouldn't start with "//" as the earlier ending "//" provides starting "//" for the current term but ends with "//"
