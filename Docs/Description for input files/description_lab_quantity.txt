description and format of the "lab_quantities.txt" file.

"lab_quantities" contains number of lab rooms for a given lab type(ex:: COMP,ELEC).

To overcome the execution delay of the source code,we limited the lab rooms of every lab type to only 1.

For every lab type the text goes as following ::

for a lab "LAB" it would be like

LAB
1

i.e 1st line with the lab label "LAB".

    2nd line with the quantity "1" (in this project it is limited to 1).
