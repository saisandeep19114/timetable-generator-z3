description and format of the every file in the format "sem$n_$department.txt" file.

As described in the "description_input.txt" $n={1,2,3} and $department={cs,me,ee} and can be extended.

Every "sem$n_$department.txt" file represents the respective courses of the sem "$n" "$department".


It starts with a line stating "START" and ends at a line with "END".

Any course and it's LTP structure(ex: "1 2 3")  goes inbetween the "START" and "END" with the following format ::

For a course "COURSE&&&" with it's LTP structure as "@ # %" goes in the file inbetween the "START" and the "END" as following term:

//
COURSE&&&
@ # %
//


NOTE::  "//" are must be included as given in the format.

        Following one course term another shouldn't start with "//" as the earlier ending "//" provides starting "//" for the current term but  ends with "//" .
