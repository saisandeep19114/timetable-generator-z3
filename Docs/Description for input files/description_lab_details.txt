description and format of the "lab_details.txt" file.

"lab_details.txt" is of a distinct format.

1st line contains labels for different distinct labs, we can add some more distinct labs with new labels (other than the existing labels).

Essential content starts from the 3rd line.

It starts with a line stating "START" and ends at a line with "END".

Any lab course and it's lab label  goes inbetween the "START" and "END" with the following format ::

For a course "COURSE&&&" with it's lab label as "LAB" goes in the file inbetween the "START" and the "END" as following term:

//
COURSE&&&
LAB
//


NOTE::  "//" are must be included as given in the format.

        Following one course term another shouldn't start with "//" as the earlier ending "//" provides starting "//" for the current term but  ends with "//".
